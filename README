django-exampleproject serves me as a solid basis to start from when initiating 
a new Django project. It integrates stuff that I use on every project 
and thus saves me some time and eliminates boring repetitive tasks.

- Support for `settings_local.py`
- `sqlite3` database with project directory as path
- Static media in "static_media/" served by `static.serve` when DEBUG is True
- `TEMPLATE_DIRS` uses "templates/" in project directory.
- Email settings configured to send to the Python DebuggingServer on port 1025
- GZipMiddleware installed
- base.html template with HTML4.01 skeleton, a few template blocks and a main.css file linked
- 404.html/500.html error page templates
- custom error 500 handler with MEDIA_URL in context
- django.contrib.admin installed
- initial_data.json with superuser fixture (admin:admin)
- django-debug-toolbar installed
- django-command-extensions installed
